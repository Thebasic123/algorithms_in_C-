# Algorithms in C++

This repository contains common algorithms written in C++14, this can be a good template for reference or build your own program.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To compile the programs, you should have gcc and cmake install in your local machine, the gcc version I use is 4.9. you can use the following instructions to compile the program.

```
cmake .
make
```

## Running the tests
Most of the programs will come with a sample of test data, stored in file ```input01.txt```, you can test the program using the following instruction.

```
./test01 < input01.txt
```
